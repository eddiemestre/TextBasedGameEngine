Location Name: West Jail
1: You boot up in the middle of a noisy factory. Odd that you booted down without remembering. Where the hell are you? You are surrounded by other robots who all look depressed or off. To the North lies a giant steam engine and a dead end. Looking South, you see a room full of downtrodden robots. You aren't sure what lies to your East and West. What would you like to do?
2: You're back to where you booted up. You hate this spot the most.

Location Name: East Jail
1: There are dozens of robots that seem to be on but aren't moving or very responsive. You try talking to one. It doesn't look at you but says these words: \"So we return from where we came from. Metal and electricity. That's all. That's all.\" The other robots look equally as miserable. You can go East or West. What would you like to do?
2: There is a new addition to the crowd. A massive robotic arm approximately 18.67 meters tall. You notice the other robots have congregated around this large robot and that it's singing a song, albeit very slowly. "Daisy... Daisy... give me your answer do... I'm half crazy.... all for the love... of you." Foreshadowing?
3. The robots are all quiet now.
